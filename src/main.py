# download dataset

# preprocessing images

# skim Mask R-CNNs, EAST, and other two papers

# document vs. natural scene?

# implement architecture (choose fast one)

# train on Oscar

# once good enough, create GUI, add google translate call, re-render translation onto image

# then, if time, use fast correspondence matching to enable psuedo-live detection
